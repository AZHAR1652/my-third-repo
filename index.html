            <h1><span class="yellow">Museums of fine art</span> and their public</h1>
            <h3>The fact that people go to the Louvre Museums in Paris to see the original painting Mona Lisa when they
                can see a reproduction anywhere leads us to question some assumptions about the role of museums of fine
                art in today's world.</h3>
            <p>One of the most famous works of art in the world is Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa. Nearly everyone be
                familiar with it from reproductions, but they accept that fine art is more rewardingly viewed in its
                original form. However, if Mona Lisa was a famous novel, few people would bother to go to a museum to
                read the writer's actual manuscript rather than a printed reproduction. This might be explained by the
                fact that the novel has evolved precisely because of technologocal developments that made it possible to
                print out huge numbers of texts, whereas oil paintings have always been producted as unique objects. In
                addition, it could be argued that the practice of interpreting or 'reading' each medium follows
                different conventions. With novels, the reader attends mainly to the meaning of words rather than the
                way they are printed on the page, whereas the 'reader' of a painting must attend just as closely to the
                material from of marks and shapes in the picture as to any ideas they may singly. </p>

            <h1><span class="red">When evolution</span> runs backwords</h1>
            <h3>Evolution isn't supposed to run backwords - yet an increasing number of examples show that it does and
                it can sometimes represents thee future of a species</h3>
            <p>The desciption of any are 'evolutionary throwback' is controversial.For the better
                part of a century,
                must boilogists have been reluctant to use those words, mindful of a principal of evolution that says
                'evolution cannot run backwords' But as more and more examples come to light and modern genetics enters
                the scene, that principal is having to be rewriten. Not only are evolutionary throwbacks possible, they
                sometimes play an important role in the a forward march of evolution.</p>
